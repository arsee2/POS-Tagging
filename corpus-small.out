For/IN six/NN years/NNS ,/, T./NN Marshall/NN Hahn/IN Jr./NN has/VBZ made/NN corporate/JJ acquisitions/NN in/IN the/DT George/TO Bush/VBD mode/NNP :/VBD kind/NN and/CC gentle/JJ ./. 
The/DT question/VBZ now/NNS :/TO Can/JJ he/PRP act/JJ more/RB like/IN hard-charging/DT Teddy/JJ Roosevelt/MD ?/. 
Mr./NNP Hahn/IN ,/, the/DT 62-year-old/NNP chairman/NN and/CC chief/JJ executive/NN officer/NN of/IN Georgia-Pacific/VBD Corp./NNS is/VBZ leading/NNS the/DT forest-product/DT concern/NN 's/POS unsolicited/JJ $/NNS 3.19/NN billion/RB bid/NNP for/IN Great/IN Northern/JJ Nekoosa/PRP$ Corp/NNS ./. 
Nekoosa/NNP has/VBZ given/JJ the/DT offer/NN a/DT public/NN cold/NN shoulder/NNS ,/, a/DT reaction/NN Mr./NNP Hahn/NNS has/VBZ n't/RB faced/PRP$ in/IN his/PRP$ 18/NN earlier/IN acquisitions/NN ,/, all/VBD of/IN which/MD were/VBD negotiated/JJ behind/JJ the/DT scenes/NNP ./. 
So/NNS far/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Hahn/NNS is/VBZ trying/NN to/TO entice/VB Nekoosa/VBD into/IN negotiating/IN a/DT friendly/NN surrender/NNS while/NN talking/NNP tough/VBD ./. 
``/`` We/NN are/VBP prepared/NNS to/TO pursue/VBN aggressively/JJ completion/VBD of/IN this/DT transaction/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP says/IN ./. 
But/CC a/DT takeover/NN battle/IN opens/NNP up/VBZ the/DT possibility/JJ of/JJ a/DT bidding/NN war/NN ,/, with/IN all/NNP that/IN implies/NN ./. 
If/VBZ a/DT competitor/NN enters/JJ the/DT game/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Hahn/NNS could/VB face/NN the/DT dilemma/DT of/IN paying/JJ a/DT premium/NNS for/IN Nekoosa/NN or/CC seeing/NN the/DT company/NN fall/NN into/IN the/DT arms/NN of/IN a/DT rival/JJ ./. 
Given/VBN that/IN choice/JJ ,/, associates/IN of/IN Mr./NNP Hahn/NN and/CC industry/NN observers/NN say/PRP$ the/DT former/NN university/JJ president/NN --/NNS who/WP has/VBZ developed/PRP$ a/DT reputation/RB for/IN not/RB overpaying/NNS for/IN anything/JJ --/NNS would/MD fold/VB ./.

He/VBN also/RB is/VBZ a/DT consensus/NN manager/IN ,/, insiders/NNS say/PRP$ ./. 
The/DT decision/NN to/TO make/JJ the/DT bid/NN for/IN Nekoosa/VBD ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, was/VBD made/JJ only/JJ after/VBN all/VBN six/JJ members/NNS of/IN Georgia-Pacific/VBD 's/POS management/NN committee/`` signed/VBD onto/VB the/DT deal/NNS --/NNS even/RB though/NN Mr./NNP Hahn/VBD knew/NNP he/PRP wanted/JJ to/TO go/JJ after/VBN the/DT company/NN early/RB on/IN ,/, says/VBZ Mr./NNP Correll/TO ./. 
Associates/VB say/RB Mr./NNP Hahn/NNS picked/NNS up/NNS that/IN careful/VBZ approach/NN to/TO management/NN as/IN president/NN of/IN Virginia/DT Polytechnic/NN Institute/NN ./. 
Assuming/NN that/IN post/NNP at/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN 35/JJ ,/, he/PRP managed/RB by/IN consensus/NN ,/, as/IN is/VBZ the/DT rule/NN in/IN universities/NNS ,/, says/NNP Warren/NNS H./NN Strother/IN ,/, a/DT university/NNS official/VBD who/WP is/IN researching/NNS a/DT book/IN on/IN Mr./NNP Hahn/JJ ./. 
But/CC he/PRP also/PRP showed/PRP$ a/DT willingness/PRP$ to/TO take/VB a/DT strong/JJ stand/JJ ./. 
In/IN 1970/NNS ,/, Mr./NNP Hahn/NNP called/VBZ in/IN state/NNP police/NNP to/TO arrest/JJ student/JJ protesters/JJ who/PRP$ were/VBD occupying/NN a/DT university/NNS building/NN ./.

In/IN 1975/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Pamplin/NN enticed/NNP Mr./NNP Hahn/NNP into/IN joining/VBG the/DT company/NN as/VBZ executive/NN vice/NN president/NN in/IN charge/VBD of/IN chemicals/JJ ;/NNS the/DT move/NN befuddled/NNS many/JJ in/IN Georgia-Pacific/NNS who/WP did/VBD n't/RB believe/VB a/DT university/NN administrator/RB could/VB make/JJ the/DT transition/NNP to/TO the/DT corporate/JJ world/NN ./. 
But/CC Mr./NNP Hahn/NNP rose/NNP swiftly/JJ through/, the/DT ranks/JJ ,/, demonstrating/JJ a/DT raw/NN intelligence/NNP that/IN he/PRP says/IN he/PRP knew/VBN he/PRP possessed/NN early/RB on/IN ./. 
The/DT son/IN of/IN a/DT physicist/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Hahn/VBZ skipped/NN first/NNP grade/NNS because/IN his/PRP$ reading/JJ ability/NN was/VBD so/RB far/NNP above/JJ his/PRP$ classmates/NNS ./.
